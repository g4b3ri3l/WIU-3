  - Oh, hello there! My names Octo, pleasure to meet you.
  - I am here to search out clues relating to a certain individual.
  - You might have heard of him before, Baby Shark. He disappeared a long time ago,
    without a trace.
  - Im trying to find him. Maybe we will see each other again! If we do, I will be
    sure to fill you in on what I have found.
  L1repeatDialogue:
  - My my, I found some interesting clues about Baby Shark.
  - Before he went missing, he used to be an Icon among Sea Life.
  - He was as popular as one can be. But over the course of a couple years, his public
    appearances slowly dropped, until he disappeared.
  - 'Thats all I have for now. Hope to see you soon! '
  L2firstTimeDialogue:
  - Well would you look at that, at this point I might consider us best friends with
    the number of times im seeing ya.
  - Well, I managed to find out more about Baby Shark! Turns out, he wasnt the only
    one that slowly disappeared.
  - His family followed the same trend! They all slowly faded out of existence, but
    why?
  - Ohoho I can feel we are about to hit something very interesting!

  L3firstTimeDialogue:
  - Hey, fancy seeing you here. This place, seen better days huh.
  - Unfortunately, I havent been able to discover much else about Baby Shark, apart
    from that it is somehow correlated to Humanity dumping trash into our Oceans.
  - Im afraid this is the end of the road for me.
  - 'Any further and I fear I may not return from this journey. If you do find out
    why, please come tell me? '
